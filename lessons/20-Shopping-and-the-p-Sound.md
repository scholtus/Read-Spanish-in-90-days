## Day 20: Shopping and the “p” Sound

![](../images/2.jpg)

### Reading (Spanish):
“Hola, yo compro pan en la panadería los lunes. Mi hermano paga poco por su café. ¿Dónde compras tú comida?”

### Translation:
“Hello, I buy bread at the bakery on Mondays. My brother pays little for his coffee. Where do you buy food?”

### Pronunciation Focus:

- The “p” sound: In Spanish, “p” is crisp and unaspirated (no puff of air), unlike the English “p” in “pan” (which has a slight breath). Keep it sharp and tight.
- Practice: Say “compro” (KOM-proh) and “pan” (pahn), focusing on a clean, quick “p” without extra air.

### Vocabulary:

- Yo compro = I buy
- Pan = Bread
- La panadería = The bakery
- Los lunes = On Mondays
- Paga = He/she pays
- Poco = Little (amount)
- Su café = His/her coffee
- ¿Dónde compras? = Where do you buy?
- Comida = Food

### Grammar Concept:

- Verb “comprar” (to buy): “Compro” = I buy; “compras” = you buy (from Day 8). Regular “-ar” verb.
- Verb “pagar” (to pay): “Paga” = he/she pays. Regular “-ar” verb.
- Possessive “su” recap: “Su café” = his/her coffee (from Day 19).

### Task:

- Read the passage aloud 3 times, keeping the “p” crisp in “compro,” “pan,” and “paga.”
- Practice: “Yo compro [item] en [place]. ¿Dónde compras tú comida?” Try “fruta” (fruit) or “leche” (milk).
