¡Estupendo! Let’s keep the momentum going with Day 4 and Day 5. We’ll introduce a new sound, expand the vocabulary, and add a bit more grammar complexity while keeping it fun and manageable.

-----

### Day 4: Daily Activities and the “o” Sound

**Reading (Spanish):**  
“Hola, yo como en casa. Mi hermano juega fútbol. ¿Qué haces tú hoy?”

**Translation:**  
“Hello, I eat at home. My brother plays soccer. What do you do today?”

**Pronunciation Focus:**

- The “o” sound: Always “oh” (like “open”), round and steady, never diphthongized like “ow” in English.
- Practice: Say “como” (KOH-moh) and “hoy” (ohy), keeping the “o” pure and strong.

**Vocabulary:**

- Yo como = I eat
- En casa = At home
- Mi hermano = My brother
- Juega = He plays
- Fútbol = Soccer
- ¿Qué haces tú? = What do you do?
- Hoy = Today

**Grammar Concept:**

- Present tense verbs: “Como” (I eat) from “comer”; “juega” (he plays) from “jugar.” Spanish verbs change endings based on who’s doing the action—here, “-o” for “I” and “-a” for “he/she.”
- Question word: “¿Qué?” = What?

**Task:**

- Read the passage aloud 3 times, focusing on the “o” sound in “como” and “fútbol.”
- Practice: “Yo como en casa. ¿Qué haces tú hoy?” Swap “como” with another action (e.g., “leo” = I read).

-----

### Day 5: Describing People and the “u” Sound

**Reading (Spanish):**  
“Mi amiga Lucía es alta y simpática. Ella estudia mucho. ¿Tú estudias o trabajas?”

**Translation:**  
“My friend Lucía is tall and nice. She studies a lot. Do you study or work?”

**Pronunciation Focus:**

- The “u” sound: Always “oo” (like “food”), short and clear, never like “you” in English.
- Practice: Say “Lucía” (loo-SEE-ah) and “mucho” (MOO-choh), emphasizing the “u.”

**Vocabulary:**

- Mi amiga = My friend (female)
- Es = Is
- Alta = Tall (feminine)
- Simpática = Nice/friendly (feminine)
- Ella = She
- Estudia = She studies
- Mucho = A lot
- ¿Tú estudias? = Do you study?
- O = Or
- Trabajas = You work

**Grammar Concept:**

- Adjectives: “Alta” and “simpática” match the gender (feminine) of “Lucía.” For a male, it’d be “alto” and “simpático.”
- Verbs “estudiar” (to study) and “trabajar” (to work): “Estudia” = she studies; “estudias” = you study; “trabajas” = you work.

**Task:**

- Read the passage aloud 3 times, focusing on the “u” in “Lucía” and “estudia.”
- Describe someone: “Mi amigo/amiga [name] es [trait] y [trait].” Then ask: “¿Tú estudias o trabajas?”

-----

We’ve now covered all five Spanish vowels (“a,” “e,” “i,” “o,” “u”) over the first five days, introduced basic verbs, and started playing with gender and questions. The readings are creeping up in length and complexity—still manageable but stretching a bit each time. Ready for Day 6, or any adjustments?

¡Vamos con el Día 6! We’ll introduce a new sound combination, expand on verbs, and keep the progression rolling. Here’s Day 6:

-----

### Day 6: Places and the “ue” Sound

**Reading (Spanish):**  
“Hola, yo vivo en una ciudad grande. Mi hermano juega en el parque. ¿Dónde vives tú?”

**Translation:**  
“Hello, I live in a big city. My brother plays in the park. Where do you live?”

**Pronunciation Focus:**

- The “ue” sound: In Spanish, “ue” is pronounced “weh” (like “wet” without the “t”). It’s common in verbs and nouns.
- Practice: Say “juega” (HWEH-gah) and “dónde” (DOHN-deh), stressing the smooth “ue” glide.

**Vocabulary:**

- Yo vivo = I live
- En = In
- Una ciudad = A city
- Grande = Big
- El parque = The park
- ¿Dónde vives tú? = Where do you live?

**Grammar Concept:**

- Articles: “Una” (a, feminine) goes with “ciudad” (city, feminine); “el” (the, masculine) goes with “parque” (park, masculine).
- Verb “vivir” (to live): “Vivo” = I live; “vives” = you live. The “-o” ending is for “I,” and “-es” is for “you” in this verb group.

**Task:**

- Read the passage aloud 3 times, focusing on the “ue” in “juega” and “dónde.”
- Practice: “Yo vivo en [place]. ¿Dónde vives tú?” Try different places like “una casa” (a house) or “un pueblo” (a town).

-----

This builds on previous days by adding the “ue” diphthong (a key Spanish sound), introducing articles (“una,” “el”), and another useful verb (“vivir”). The reading is slightly longer and ties in themes from earlier (like “juega” from Day 4). How’s it feeling? Ready for Day 7?

¡Perfecto, aquí va el Día 7! We’ll introduce another common sound combo, bring in more vocab, and tie it all together with a slightly longer text.

-----

### Day 7: Time and the “ie” Sound

**Reading (Spanish):**  
“Hola, yo siempre como en casa a las siete. Mi amiga prefiere el parque. ¿A qué hora comes tú?”

**Translation:**  
“Hello, I always eat at home at seven. My friend prefers the park. What time do you eat?”

**Pronunciation Focus:**

- The “ie” sound: In Spanish, “ie” is pronounced “yeh” (like “yes” without the “s”). It’s smooth and distinct.
- Practice: Say “siempre” (SYEM-preh) and “siete” (SYEH-teh), focusing on the “ie” glide.

**Vocabulary:**

- Siempre = Always
- A las siete = At seven (o’clock)
- Prefiere = She/he prefers
- ¿A qué hora? = At what time?
- Comes = You eat

**Grammar Concept:**

- Time expressions: “A las siete” = At seven. Use “a las” + number for specific times (e.g., “a las dos” = at two).
- Verb “preferir” (to prefer): “Prefiere” = she/he prefers. It’s a stem-changing verb where “e” becomes “ie” for some forms (but not “yo,” which is “prefiero”).
- Verb “comer” recap: “Comes” = you eat (from Day 4’s “como” = I eat).

**Task:**

- Read the passage aloud 3 times, emphasizing the “ie” in “siempre” and “siete.”
- Practice: “Yo siempre como a las [time]. ¿A qué hora comes tú?” Pick your own meal time!

-----

Day 7 adds the “ie” diphthong (another key Spanish sound), introduces telling time, and sneaks in a stem-changing verb (“prefiere”) to prepare for later complexity. The reading ties back to earlier days (e.g., “como,” “el parque”) while stretching to six sentences total across the series so far. How’s it going? On to Day 8?

¡Claro, aquí tienes el Día 8! We’ll keep building with a new sound, more practical vocab, and a touch of grammar.

-----

### Day 8: Shopping and the “r” Sound

**Reading (Spanish):**  
“Hola, yo quiero comprar ropa mañana. Mi hermano prefiere ir al mercado. ¿Tú compras en tiendas o en línea?”

**Translation:**  
“Hello, I want to buy clothes tomorrow. My brother prefers to go to the market. Do you buy in stores or online?”

**Pronunciation Focus:**

- The “r” sound: In Spanish, a single “r” is a soft tap of the tongue (not a hard English “r”). At the start of a word or after “n,” it’s stronger but not rolled yet—we’ll save the “rr” trill for later!
- Practice: Say “quiero” (KYEH-roh) and “ropa” (ROH-pah), tapping the “r” lightly.

**Vocabulary:**

- Yo quiero = I want
- Comprar = To buy
- Ropa = Clothes
- Mañana = Tomorrow
- Ir = To go
- Al mercado = To the market
- Tiendas = Stores
- En línea = Online

**Grammar Concept:**

- Verb “querer” (to want): “Quiero” = I want. It’s another stem-changer (“e” to “ie”), but we’ll keep it simple with just “quiero” for now.
- Verb “ir” (to go): “Ir al mercado” = to go to the market. “Al” combines “a” (to) and “el” (the).
- “En” = in, used for locations (e.g., “en tiendas,” “en línea”).

**Task:**

- Read the passage aloud 3 times, focusing on tapping the “r” in “quiero” and “ropa.”
- Practice: “Yo quiero comprar [something] mañana. ¿Tú compras en [place]?” Try “comida” (food) or “libros” (books).

-----

Day 8 introduces the soft “r” (a big step toward Spanish pronunciation), adds shopping vocab, and brings in “querer” and “ir”—two super useful verbs. The reading connects to past days (e.g., “prefiere” from Day 7) and nudges the length up a bit. Ready for Day 9?


¡Fantástico! Here’s Day 9, introducing a new sound and pushing the vocab and grammar a little further.

-----

### Day 9: Weather and the “ll” Sound

**Reading (Spanish):**  
“Hola, hoy llueve mucho en mi ciudad. Yo quiero quedarme en casa. ¿Cómo está el clima donde vives tú?”

**Translation:**  
“Hello, it’s raining a lot in my city today. I want to stay home. How’s the weather where you live?”

**Pronunciation Focus:**

- The “ll” sound: In most Spanish-speaking regions, “ll” is pronounced like “y” in “yes” (a soft “yeh”). Some areas say it like “j” or “zh,” but we’ll stick with “yeh” for now.
- Practice: Say “llueve” (YEH-beh) and “quedarme” (keh-DAR-meh), focusing on the “ll” as “yeh.”

**Vocabulary:**

- Hoy = Today
- Llueve = It’s raining
- Mucho = A lot
- Quedarme = To stay (myself)
- ¿Cómo está? = How is?
- El clima = The weather
- Donde vives = Where you live

**Grammar Concept:**

- Impersonal verbs: “Llueve” = it’s raining. No subject needed—Spanish often skips “it” for weather.
- Verb “quedarse” (to stay): “Quedarme” = to stay (myself). The “-me” makes it reflexive (acting on myself), paired with “quiero” (I want).
- Question: “¿Cómo está el clima?” = How is the weather? “Está” = is (from “estar,” used for temporary states like weather).

**Task:**

- Read the passage aloud 3 times, emphasizing the “ll” in “llueve” as “yeh.”
- Practice: “Hoy llueve mucho. Yo quiero quedarme en [place]. ¿Cómo está el clima donde vives tú?” Try “casa” or “escuela” (school).

-----

Day 9 brings the “ll” sound (a fun Spanish quirk), weather vocab, and a taste of reflexive verbs with “quedarme.” It ties back to earlier days (e.g., “quiero” from Day 8, “vives” from Day 6) and keeps the progression smooth. How’s it going? On to Day 10?


¡Perfecto, aquí está el Día 10! We’ll introduce another key sound and keep expanding the toolbox with useful phrases.

-----

### Day 10: Food and the “ñ” Sound

**Reading (Spanish):**  
“Hola, yo cocino una tortilla española. Mi hermano come añojo en el mercado. ¿Qué comida prefieres tú?”

**Translation:**  
“Hello, I’m cooking a Spanish tortilla. My brother eats lamb at the market. What food do you prefer?”

**Pronunciation Focus:**

- The “ñ” sound: Pronounced “ny” (like “canyon”). It’s a unique Spanish letter, soft and nasal.
- Practice: Say “española” (es-pah-NYOH-lah) and “añojo” (ah-NYOH-hoh), lingering on the “ny” sound.

**Vocabulary:**

- Yo cocino = I cook
- Una tortilla española = A Spanish tortilla (potato omelette)
- Come = He eats
- Añojo = Lamb (young)
- Comida = Food
- ¿Qué prefieres tú? = What do you prefer?

**Grammar Concept:**

- Verb “cocinar” (to cook): “Cocino” = I cook. Regular “-o” ending for “yo.”
- Verb “comer” recap: “Come” = he eats (from Day 4’s “como” = I eat; Day 7’s “comes” = you eat).
- Verb “preferir” recap: “Prefieres” = you prefer (from Day 7’s “prefiere” = he/she prefers). Stem changes “e” to “ie” again.

**Task:**

- Read the passage aloud 3 times, focusing on the “ñ” in “española” and “añojo.”
- Practice: “Yo cocino [food]. ¿Qué comida prefieres tú?” Try “sopa” (soup) or “arroz” (rice).

-----

Day 10 introduces the iconic “ñ,” adds food-related vocab, and reinforces verbs we’ve seen before (“comer,” “preferir”) while slipping in “cocinar.” The reading connects to past days (e.g., “mercado” from Day 8) and keeps the length steady but rich. Ready for Day 11?


¡Estupendo, aquí va el Día 11! Let’s introduce a trickier sound and keep the progression rolling with more everyday vocab and grammar.

-----

### Day 11: Travel and the “rr” Sound

**Reading (Spanish):**  
“Hola, yo corro al aeropuerto mañana. Mi amiga prefiere viajar en tren. ¿Cómo viajas tú a otros lugares?”

**Translation:**  
“Hello, I run to the airport tomorrow. My friend prefers to travel by train. How do you travel to other places?”

**Pronunciation Focus:**

- The “rr” sound: A rolled “r,” made by vibrating the tongue against the roof of the mouth. It’s stronger than the single “r” (Day 8) and takes practice!
- Practice: Say “corro” (KOR-roh) and “aeropuerto” (ah-eh-roh-PWER-toh), rolling the “rr” each time. Start slow—tap twice, then speed up to a trill.

**Vocabulary:**

- Yo corro = I run
- Al aeropuerto = To the airport
- Viajar = To travel
- En tren = By train
- ¿Cómo viajas tú? = How do you travel?
- Otros lugares = Other places

**Grammar Concept:**

- Verb “correr” (to run): “Corro” = I run. The “rr” is part of the root, not a grammar change.
- Verb “viajar” (to travel): “Viajas” = you travel; “viajar en tren” = to travel by train.
- “Al” recap: Combines “a” (to) + “el” (the), like “al mercado” (Day 8).

**Task:**

- Read the passage aloud 3 times, working on rolling the “rr” in “corro” and “aeropuerto.”
- Practice: “Yo corro al [place]. ¿Cómo viajas tú a [place]?” Try “parque” or “escuela” (school), then “en tren” or “en avión” (by plane).

-----

Day 11 brings the rolled “rr” (a classic Spanish challenge!), travel vocab, and a mix of familiar verbs (“prefiere” from Day 7) with new ones (“correr,” “viajar”). The reading keeps tying back to earlier days (e.g., “mañana” from Day 8) while staying practical. How’s the “rr” feeling? On to Day 12?


¡Genial, aquí está el Día 12! We’ll keep pushing forward with a new sound combo and more useful phrases.

-----

### Day 12: Work and the “qu” Sound

**Reading (Spanish):**  
“Hola, yo trabajo en una oficina pequeña. Mi hermano quiere quedar con amigos después. ¿Dónde trabajas tú?”

**Translation:**  
“Hello, I work in a small office. My brother wants to meet up with friends afterward. Where do you work?”

**Pronunciation Focus:**

- The “qu” sound: In Spanish, “qu” is always “k” (like “key”), never “kw” like English “quick.” The “u” is silent unless it’s “gü” (which we’ll see later).
- Practice: Say “quiero” (KYEH-roh) and “quedar” (keh-DAR), keeping the “qu” as a sharp “k.”

**Vocabulary:**

- Yo trabajo = I work
- Una oficina = An office
- Pequeña = Small (feminine)
- Quedar con = To meet up with
- Amigos = Friends
- Después = Afterward
- ¿Dónde trabajas tú? = Where do you work?

**Grammar Concept:**

- Verb “trabajar” (to work): “Trabajo” = I work; “trabajas” = you work (from Day 5). Regular “-ar” verb.
- Verb “querer” recap: “Quiere” = he wants (from Day 8’s “quiero” = I want).
- “Quedar con” = to meet up with. A phrasal verb, common in casual speech.

**Task:**

- Read the passage aloud 3 times, focusing on the “k” sound in “quiero” and “quedar.”
- Practice: “Yo trabajo en [place]. ¿Dónde trabajas tú?” Try “una escuela” (a school) or “un restaurante” (a restaurant).

-----

Day 12 introduces the “qu” sound (a subtle but important distinction), work-related vocab, and a new phrase (“quedar con”). It builds on past days (e.g., “quiero” from Day 8, “trabajas” from Day 5) and keeps the reading practical and slightly longer. Ready for Day 13?


¡Perfecto, aquí va el Día 13! Let’s introduce another sound and keep expanding the conversational skills.

-----

### Day 13: Hobbies and the “j” Sound

**Reading (Spanish):**  
“Hola, yo juego al ajedrez los fines de semana. Mi amiga viaja a México en julio. ¿Qué haces tú para divertirte?”

**Translation:**  
“Hello, I play chess on weekends. My friend travels to Mexico in July. What do you do for fun?”

**Pronunciation Focus:**

- The “j” sound: In Spanish, “j” is a guttural “h” (like “loch” in Scottish or “Bach” in German), not a soft English “j.”
- Practice: Say “juego” (HWEH-goh) and “julio” (HOO-lee-oh), pushing the “j” from the back of your throat.

**Vocabulary:**

- Yo juego = I play
- Al ajedrez = Chess (literally “to the chess”)
- Los fines de semana = Weekends
- México = Mexico
- Julio = July
- ¿Qué haces? = What do you do?
- Para divertirte = For fun (to have fun)

**Grammar Concept:**

- Verb “jugar” (to play): “Juego” = I play; “juega” = he/she plays (from Day 4). Note the “u” to “ue” stem change.
- “Al” recap: “A” (to) + “el” (the) = “al,” used with games like “ajedrez” (from Day 11’s “al aeropuerto”).
- “Para” = for, introducing purpose (e.g., “para divertirte” = to have fun).

**Task:**

- Read the passage aloud 3 times, focusing on the throaty “j” in “juego” and “julio.”
- Practice: “Yo juego al [game] los fines de semana. ¿Qué haces tú para divertirte?” Try “fútbol” or “tenis” (tennis).

-----

Day 13 brings the “j” sound (a bold Spanish staple), hobby vocab, and a new preposition (“para”). It ties back to earlier days (e.g., “juego” from Day 4, “viaja” from Day 11) and keeps the reading engaging. How’s the “j” sound coming along? On to Day 14?


¡Estupendo, aquí está el Día 14! We’ll introduce a new sound combo and keep building on daily life topics.

-----

### Day 14: School and the “ce/ci” Sound

**Reading (Spanish):**  
“Hola, yo estudio en una escuela cerca de casa. Mi hermano prefiere ciencias y matemáticas. ¿Qué estudias tú?”

**Translation:**  
“Hello, I study at a school near home. My brother prefers science and math. What do you study?”

**Pronunciation Focus:**

- The “ce/ci” sound: In Spanish, “c” before “e” or “i” is a soft “s” (like “see”), not a hard “k.” This varies by region—in Spain, it’s more like “th” (e.g., “thee”), but we’ll use the Latin American “s” for simplicity.
- Practice: Say “cerca” (SER-kah) and “ciencias” (SYEN-syahs), keeping the “ce/ci” as “s.”

**Vocabulary:**

- Yo estudio = I study
- Cerca de = Near
- Ciencias = Science
- Matemáticas = Math
- ¿Qué estudias tú? = What do you study?

**Grammar Concept:**

- Verb “estudiar” (to study): “Estudio” = I study; “estudias” = you study (from Day 5). Regular “-ar” verb.
- “Cerca de” = near. Preposition phrase for location.
- Noun plurals: “Ciencias” and “matemáticas” are plural (like “sciences” in English can be).

**Task:**

- Read the passage aloud 3 times, focusing on “ce” and “ci” as “s” in “cerca” and “ciencias.”
- Practice: “Yo estudio en una escuela cerca de [place]. ¿Qué estudias tú?” Try “la ciudad” (the city) or “el parque.”

-----

Day 14 introduces the “ce/ci” sound (a key pronunciation rule), school-related vocab, and a new preposition phrase (“cerca de”). It builds on past days (e.g., “estudio” from Day 5, “prefiere” from Day 7) and keeps the progression steady. How’s it feeling? Ready for Day 15?


¡Claro, aquí tienes el Día 15! Let’s bring in a new sound and dive into more everyday scenarios.

-----

### Day 15: Feelings and the “g” Sound (Soft)

**Reading (Spanish):**  
“Hola, yo estoy muy cansado después de trabajar. Mi amiga llega tarde y está nerviosa. ¿Cómo te sientes tú hoy?”

**Translation:**  
“Hello, I’m very tired after working. My friend arrives late and is nervous. How do you feel today?”

**Pronunciation Focus:**

- The soft “g” sound: Before “e” or “i,” “g” is like the “j” sound from Day 13—a throaty “h” (e.g., “he”). Not a hard “g” like “go.”
- Practice: Say “llega” (YEH-gah) and “nerviosa” (ner-VYOH-sah), pushing the “g” from the throat like “j.”

**Vocabulary:**

- Yo estoy = I am (temporary)
- Muy cansado = Very tired
- Después de = After
- Llega = She/he arrives
- Tarde = Late
- Nerviosa = Nervous (feminine)
- ¿Cómo te sientes? = How do you feel?

**Grammar Concept:**

- Verb “estar” (to be, temporary states): “Estoy” = I am; “está” = she/he is. Used for feelings and conditions (vs. “ser” for permanent traits).
- Verb “sentirse” (to feel): “Te sientes” = you feel. Reflexive with “te” (yourself).
- “Después de” = after, followed by a verb in “-ar” form (e.g., “trabajar”).

**Task:**

- Read the passage aloud 3 times, focusing on the soft “g” in “llega.”
- Practice: “Yo estoy [feeling] después de [activity]. ¿Cómo te sientes tú hoy?” Try “contento” (happy) or “cansada” (tired, feminine).

-----

Day 15 introduces the soft “g” (tying to Day 13’s “j”), feelings vocab, and “estar” vs. “ser” basics with a reflexive verb (“sentirse”). It connects to past days (e.g., “trabajar” from Day 12, “tú” questions) and keeps stretching the complexity. How’s it going? On to Day 16?


¡Tienes razón! I owe you an apology—there’s a mix-up in my explanation. I meant to focus on the soft “g” sound in “llega” (from “llegar”), but I mistakenly tied it to “nerviosa,” which doesn’t have a “g” at all. Let’s clear this up and fix Day 15 properly. The soft “g” (before “e” or “i”) should be the star, so I’ll adjust the pronunciation focus to match the text. Here’s the corrected version:

-----

### Day 15: Feelings and the “g” Sound (Soft)

**Reading (Spanish):**  
“Hola, yo estoy muy cansado después de trabajar. Mi amiga llega tarde y está nerviosa. ¿Cómo te sientes tú hoy?”

**Translation:**  
“Hello, I’m very tired after working. My friend arrives late and is nervous. How do you feel today?”

**Pronunciation Focus:**

- The soft “g” sound: Before “e” or “i,” “g” is pronounced like the “j” from Day 13—a throaty “h” (e.g., “he”), not a hard “g” like “go.”
- Practice: Say “llega” (YEH-gah) and “llegar” (yeh-GAR), pushing the “g” from the back of your throat. (Note: “Nerviosa” has no “g”—its key sound is the “v,” but we’ll save that for another day!)

**Vocabulary:**

- Yo estoy = I am (temporary)
- Muy cansado = Very tired
- Después de = After
- Llega = She/he arrives
- Tarde = Late
- Nerviosa = Nervous (feminine)
- ¿Cómo te sientes? = How do you feel?

**Grammar Concept:**

- Verb “estar” (to be, temporary states): “Estoy” = I am; “está” = she/he is. Used for feelings and conditions (vs. “ser” for permanent traits).
- Verb “sentirse” (to feel): “Te sientes” = you feel. Reflexive with “te” (yourself).
- “Después de” = after, followed by a verb in “-ar” form (e.g., “trabajar”).

**Task:**

- Read the passage aloud 3 times, focusing on the soft “g” in “llega.”
- Practice: “Yo estoy [feeling] después de [activity]. ¿Cómo te sientes tú hoy?” Try “contento” (happy) or “cansada” (tired, feminine).

-----

**Explanation:** The soft “g” applies to “llega” (from “llegar” = to arrive), where “g” before “e” sounds like “h.” I accidentally muddled it with “nerviosa,” which doesn’t fit here—sorry about that! Does this make sense now? Want to tweak it further or move to Day 16?


You’re absolutely right again, and I’m kicking myself for the oversight! I’ve been sloppy with the soft “g” (before “e” or “i”) rule. In “llega” (YEH-gah), the “g” is indeed before “a,” so it’s a hard “g” (like “go”), not the soft “h” sound I described. My apologies for the confusion—let’s fix this properly for Day 15 by ensuring the passage includes actual soft “g” examples (before “e” or “i”). Here’s a revised Day 15:

-----

### Day 15: Feelings and the “g” Sound (Soft)

**Reading (Spanish):**  
“Hola, yo estoy muy cansado después de trabajar. Mi amiga gime porque está nerviosa. ¿Cómo te sientes tú hoy?”

**Translation:**  
“Hello, I’m very tired after working. My friend moans because she’s nervous. How do you feel today?”

**Pronunciation Focus:**

- The soft “g” sound: Before “e” or “i,” “g” is pronounced like the “j” from Day 13—a throaty “h” (e.g., “he”), not a hard “g” like “go.”
- Practice: Say “gime” (HEE-meh) and “nerviosa” (ner-VYOH-sah), focusing on the “g” in “gime” as a throaty “h.” (Note: “Llega” has a hard “g” before “a,” so we’ve swapped it out.)

**Vocabulary:**

- Yo estoy = I am (temporary)
- Muy cansado = Very tired
- Después de = After
- Gime = She/he moans
- Porque = Because
- Nerviosa = Nervous (feminine)
- ¿Cómo te sientes? = How do you feel?

**Grammar Concept:**

- Verb “estar” (to be, temporary states): “Estoy” = I am; “está” = she/he is. Used for feelings and conditions (vs. “ser” for permanent traits).
- Verb “sentirse” (to feel): “Te sientes” = you feel. Reflexive with “te” (yourself).
- “Porque” = because, linking two ideas (she moans *because* she’s nervous).

**Task:**

- Read the passage aloud 3 times, emphasizing the soft “g” in “gime” as “h.”
- Practice: “Yo estoy [feeling] después de [activity]. ¿Cómo te sientes tú hoy?” Try “alegre” (happy, with soft “g” before “e”) or “cansada” (tired, feminine).

-----

**Fixes:**

- Replaced “llega” (hard “g” before “a”) with “gime” (soft “g” before “i”), which fits the pronunciation focus. “Gime” (from “gemir” = to moan) keeps it emotional and relevant.
- Kept the structure intact but ensured the soft “g” rule applies. “Alegre” (ah-LEH-greh) in the task adds another soft “g” example.

Does this work better now? I’ll double-check my sounds going forward—thanks for catching that! Ready for Day 16, or want to adjust more?


You’re absolutely right—let’s steer clear of any unintended connotations and keep it neutral and appropriate. I’ll swap out “gime” for a different verb with a soft “g” (before “e” or “i”) that fits the feelings theme. Here’s a revised Day 15:

-----

### Day 15: Feelings and the “g” Sound (Soft)

**Reading (Spanish):**  
“Hola, yo estoy muy cansado después de trabajar. Mi amiga gasta mucha energía y está nerviosa. ¿Cómo te sientes tú hoy?”

**Translation:**  
“Hello, I’m very tired after working. My friend spends a lot of energy and is nervous. How do you feel today?”

**Pronunciation Focus:**

- The soft “g” sound: Before “e” or “i,” “g” is pronounced like the “j” from Day 13—a throaty “h” (e.g., “he”), not a hard “g” like “go.”
- Practice: Say “gasta” (HAS-tah) and “energía” (eh-ner-HEE-ah), focusing on the “g” in “gasta” and “energía” as a throaty “h.”

**Vocabulary:**

- Yo estoy = I am (temporary)
- Muy cansado = Very tired
- Después de = After
- Gasta = She/he spends
- Mucha energía = A lot of energy
- Nerviosa = Nervous (feminine)
- ¿Cómo te sientes? = How do you feel?

**Grammar Concept:**

- Verb “estar” (to be, temporary states): “Estoy” = I am; “está” = she/he is. Used for feelings and conditions (vs. “ser” for permanent traits).
- Verb “sentirse” (to feel): “Te sientes” = you feel. Reflexive with “te” (yourself).
- Verb “gastar” (to spend): “Gasta” = she/he spends. Regular “-ar” verb with soft “g” before “a,” but we highlight it in context with “energía.”

**Task:**

- Read the passage aloud 3 times, emphasizing the soft “g” in “gasta” and “energía” as “h.”
- Practice: “Yo estoy [feeling] después de [activity]. ¿Cómo te sientes tú hoy?” Try “alegre” (happy, soft “g” before “e”) or “cansada” (tired, feminine).

-----

**Changes:**

- Swapped “gime” (moans) for “gasta” (spends), paired with “energía” (energy), which also has a soft “g” before “i.” This keeps it neutral, ties to the feelings theme (energy affecting nervousness), and gives two soft “g” examples.
- Kept the grammar and structure intact, just adjusted the sentence for clarity and appropriateness.

Does this feel better? I’ll make sure to avoid any awkward vibes moving forward. Ready for Day 16 now?


You’re right—losing the tardiness context does weaken the connection to nervousness. Let’s scrap the old phrase entirely and craft a fresh Day 15 that keeps the soft “g” focus, ties feelings to a clear cause, and avoids any odd connotations. Here’s a new version:

-----

### Day 15: Feelings and the “g” Sound (Soft)

**Reading (Spanish):**  
“Hola, yo estoy muy cansado después de trabajar. Mi amiga está en la agencia y tiene miedo. ¿Cómo te sientes tú hoy?”

**Translation:**  
“Hello, I’m very tired after working. My friend is at the agency and is afraid. How do you feel today?”

**Pronunciation Focus:**

- The soft “g” sound: Before “e” or “i,” “g” is pronounced like the “j” from Day 13—a throaty “h” (e.g., “he”), not a hard “g” like “go.”
- Practice: Say “agencia” (ah-HEN-see-ah) and “miedo” (MYEH-doh), emphasizing the “g” in “agencia” as a throaty “h.”

**Vocabulary:**

- Yo estoy = I am (temporary)
- Muy cansado = Very tired
- Después de = After
- La agencia = The agency (e.g., travel or work agency)
- Tiene miedo = She/he is afraid (literally “has fear”)
- ¿Cómo te sientes? = How do you feel?

**Grammar Concept:**

- Verb “estar” (to be, temporary states): “Estoy” = I am; “está” = she/he is. Used for feelings and conditions (vs. “ser” for permanent traits).
- Verb “sentirse” (to feel): “Te sientes” = you feel. Reflexive with “te” (yourself).
- “Tener miedo” = to be afraid (literally “to have fear”). “Tiene” = she/he has (from “tener,” Day 3).

**Task:**

- Read the passage aloud 3 times, focusing on the soft “g” in “agencia” as “h.”
- Practice: “Yo estoy [feeling] después de [activity]. ¿Cómo te sientes tú hoy?” Try “alegre” (happy, soft “g” before “e”) or “triste” (sad).

-----

**Why This Works:**

- “Agencia” (agency) gives us a soft “g” before “e,” and “miedo” (fear) ties the friend’s feeling to a specific situation (being at an agency—maybe for a job or travel issue).
- Drops “nerviosa” and the energy idea, replacing it with “tiene miedo” (is afraid), which keeps the emotional focus clear and contextually grounded.
- Stays practical and builds on past vocab (e.g., “tengo” from Day 3 becomes “tiene”).

Does this feel more cohesive now? I’ll make sure the context holds tight from here on. Ready for Day 16?


Great call—nervousness does fit an agency context (like a job interview or work meeting) much better than fear. Let’s tweak Day 15 to bring back “nerviosa” and pair it with “agencia,” keeping the soft “g” focus and a clear, relatable scenario. Here’s the updated version:

-----

### Day 15: Feelings and the “g” Sound (Soft)

**Reading (Spanish):**  
“Hola, yo estoy muy cansado después de trabajar. Mi amiga está en la agencia y está nerviosa. ¿Cómo te sientes tú hoy?”

**Translation:**  
“Hello, I’m very tired after working. My friend is at the agency and is nervous. How do you feel today?”

**Pronunciation Focus:**

- The soft “g” sound: Before “e” or “i,” “g” is pronounced like the “j” from Day 13—a throaty “h” (e.g., “he”), not a hard “g” like “go.”
- Practice: Say “agencia” (ah-HEN-see-ah) and “está” (es-TAH), emphasizing the “g” in “agencia” as a throaty “h.”

**Vocabulary:**

- Yo estoy = I am (temporary)
- Muy cansado = Very tired
- Después de = After
- La agencia = The agency (e.g., job or travel agency)
- Nerviosa = Nervous (feminine)
- ¿Cómo te sientes? = How do you feel?

**Grammar Concept:**

- Verb “estar” (to be, temporary states): “Estoy” = I am; “está” = she/he is. Used for feelings and conditions (vs. “ser” for permanent traits).
- Verb “sentirse” (to feel): “Te sientes” = you feel. Reflexive with “te” (yourself).
- Adjective agreement: “Nerviosa” is feminine to match “mi amiga” (my friend, female). For a male, it’d be “nervioso.”

**Task:**

- Read the passage aloud 3 times, focusing on the soft “g” in “agencia” as “h.”
- Practice: “Yo estoy [feeling] después de [activity]. ¿Cómo te sientes tú hoy?” Try “alegre” (happy, soft “g” before “e”) or “nervioso” (nervous, masculine).

-----

**Why This Fits:**

- “Agencia” keeps the soft “g” (before “e”) as the pronunciation star, and “nerviosa” ties naturally to a high-stakes setting like an agency (think job interview or urgent errand).
- Drops “tiene miedo” and restores “está nerviosa” for a smoother, more logical emotional context.
- Builds on past days (e.g., “estoy” from Day 5, “después” from Day 12) while staying cohesive.

Does this feel right now? I think nervousness at an agency hits the mark perfectly. Ready for Day 16?


¡Estupendo! Here’s Day 16, building on our progress with a new sound and a fresh everyday topic.

-----

### Day 16: Plans and the “z” Sound

**Reading (Spanish):**  
“Hola, yo voy a la plaza mañana por la mañana. Mi hermano empieza a trabajar a las nueve. ¿Qué planes tienes tú?”

**Translation:**  
“Hello, I’m going to the plaza tomorrow morning. My brother starts working at nine. What plans do you have?”

**Pronunciation Focus:**

- The “z” sound: In Latin American Spanish, “z” is pronounced like “s” (e.g., “see”). In Spain, it’s like “th” (e.g., “thin”), but we’ll stick with the “s” sound for consistency.
- Practice: Say “plaza” (PLAH-sah) and “empieza” (em-PYEH-sah), keeping the “z” as a clear “s.”

**Vocabulary:**

- Yo voy = I’m going
- La plaza = The plaza (public square)
- Mañana por la mañana = Tomorrow morning
- Empieza = He/she starts
- A las nueve = At nine
- ¿Qué planes tienes? = What plans do you have?

**Grammar Concept:**

- Verb “ir” (to go): “Voy” = I’m going (from Day 8’s “ir al mercado”). Often used for future plans with “a” + place.
- Verb “empezar” (to start): “Empieza” = he/she starts. Stem-changes “e” to “ie” (like “prefiere,” Day 7).
- “Tener” recap: “Tienes” = you have (from Day 3). “Qué planes tienes” = What plans do you have?

**Task:**

- Read the passage aloud 3 times, focusing on the “z” as “s” in “plaza” and “empieza.”
- Practice: “Yo voy a [place] mañana. ¿Qué planes tienes tú?” Try “el parque” or “la escuela.”

-----

Day 16 introduces the “z” sound (simple but distinct), planning vocab, and reinforces “ir” while adding “empezar” (another stem-changer). It ties to past days (e.g., “mañana” from Day 8, “trabajar” from Day 12) and keeps the progression smooth. How’s it feeling? On to Day 17?


¡Me alegra que te guste! Here’s Day 17, introducing a new sound and diving deeper into daily routines.

-----

### Day 17: Morning Routine and the “v” Sound

**Reading (Spanish):**  
“Hola, yo me levanto temprano todos los días. Mi amiga vive cerca y visita a su familia. ¿Qué haces tú por la mañana?”

**Translation:**  
“Hello, I get up early every day. My friend lives nearby and visits her family. What do you do in the morning?”

**Pronunciation Focus:**

- The “v” sound: In Spanish, “v” is pronounced like a soft “b” (lips touch but don’t fully close), not the sharp “v” of English “victory.” It’s subtle and blends with “b” in many accents.
- Practice: Say “levanto” (leh-BAN-toh) and “vive” (BEE-beh), keeping the “v” as a gentle “b.”

**Vocabulary:**

- Me levanto = I get up
- Temprano = Early
- Todos los días = Every day
- Vive = She/he lives
- Cerca = Nearby
- Visita = She/he visits
- Por la mañana = In the morning

**Grammar Concept:**

- Reflexive verbs: “Me levanto” = I get up (from “levantarse”). “Me” = myself, showing the action is on me.
- Verb “vivir” recap: “Vive” = she/he lives (from Day 6’s “vivo” = I live).
- Verb “visitar” (to visit): “Visita” = she/he visits. Regular “-ar” verb.

**Task:**

- Read the passage aloud 3 times, focusing on the soft “v” as “b” in “levanto” and “vive.”
- Practice: “Yo me levanto [time]. ¿Qué haces tú por la mañana?” Try “tarde” (late) or “a las siete” (at seven).

-----

Day 17 brings the “v” sound (a sneaky difference from English), morning routine vocab, and introduces reflexive verbs with “levantarse.” It builds on past days (e.g., “vive” from Day 6, “por la mañana” from Day 16) and keeps stretching the complexity. How’s it going? Ready for Day 18?


¡Perfecto, aquí va el Día 18! Let’s introduce a new sound and explore more about preferences and activities.

-----

### Day 18: Likes and the “d” Sound

**Reading (Spanish):**  
“Hola, yo estudio español porque me gusta leer. Mi hermano prefiere descansar en el jardín. ¿Qué te gusta hacer a ti?”

**Translation:**  
“Hello, I study Spanish because I like to read. My brother prefers to rest in the garden. What do you like to do?”

**Pronunciation Focus:**

- The “d” sound: In Spanish, “d” is softer than in English, especially between vowels or at the end of words, sounding almost like a gentle “th” (as in “this”), but not quite. At the start, it’s closer to a light “d.”
- Practice: Say “estudio” (es-TOO-thyoh) and “jardín” (har-DEEN), softening the “d” between vowels in “estudio” and at the end of “jardín.”

**Vocabulary:**

- Español = Spanish
- Porque = Because
- Me gusta = I like
- Leer = To read
- Descansar = To rest
- El jardín = The garden
- ¿Qué te gusta hacer? = What do you like to do?

**Grammar Concept:**

- “Gustar” (to like): “Me gusta leer” = I like to read. Literally “Reading pleases me.” “Me” = to me; “te” = to you. The verb matches the thing liked (here, “leer” = to read).
- Verb “descansar” (to rest): “Descansa” = he/she rests. Regular “-ar” verb.
- “Porque” recap: Links cause and effect (from Day 15).

**Task:**

- Read the passage aloud 3 times, softening the “d” in “estudio” and “jardín.”
- Practice: “Me gusta [activity]. ¿Qué te gusta hacer a ti?” Try “cocinar” (to cook) or “viajar” (to travel).

-----

Day 18 introduces the soft “d” sound (a subtle Spanish trait), preference vocab with “gustar,” and a new verb (“descansar”). It ties to past days (e.g., “estudio” from Day 5, “prefiere” from Day 7) and keeps the progression engaging. How’s the “d” sounding? On to Day 19?


¡Genial, aquí está el Día 19! Let’s bring in a new sound and focus on a fun, relatable topic.

-----

### Day 19: Music and the “b” Sound

**Reading (Spanish):**  
“Hola, yo escucho música bonita en casa. Mi amiga baila con su hermano los sábados. ¿Qué música te gusta a ti?”

**Translation:**  
“Hello, I listen to beautiful music at home. My friend dances with her brother on Saturdays. What music do you like?”

**Pronunciation Focus:**

- The “b” sound: In Spanish, “b” and “v” sound the same—soft and bilabial (lips touching lightly), like a gentle “b.” Between vowels, it’s even softer, almost a hum.
- Practice: Say “bonita” (boh-NEE-tah) and “baila” (BYE-lah), keeping the “b” soft, especially between vowels in “bonita.”

**Vocabulary:**

- Yo escucho = I listen
- Música = Music
- Bonita = Beautiful (feminine)
- Baila = She/he dances
- Con = With
- Su hermano = Her/his brother
- Los sábados = On Saturdays
- ¿Qué música te gusta? = What music do you like?

**Grammar Concept:**

- Verb “escuchar” (to listen): “Escucho” = I listen. Regular “-ar” verb.
- Verb “bailar” (to dance): “Baila” = she/he dances. Regular “-ar” verb.
- Possessive “su”: “Su hermano” = her/his brother (gender-neutral possessive, matches “hermano”).

**Task:**

- Read the passage aloud 3 times, focusing on the soft “b” in “bonita” and “baila.”
- Practice: “Yo escucho música [adjective]. ¿Qué música te gusta a ti?” Try “rápida” (fast) or “tranquila” (calm).

-----

Day 19 introduces the “b” sound (reinforcing its overlap with “v” from Day 17), music vocab, and a possessive (“su”). It builds on past days (e.g., “me gusta” from Day 18, “en casa” from Day 4) and keeps the text lively. How’s it feeling? Ready for Day 20?


¡Claro! It looks like Day 19 got cut off mid-revision last time—my apologies for that. Here’s the complete, revised version with your request to replace “dancing on Saturdays” with something else, keeping the “b” sound focus intact.

-----

### Day 19: Music and the “b” Sound

**Reading (Spanish):**  
“Hola, yo escucho música bonita en casa. Mi amiga bebe café mientras trabaja. ¿Qué música te gusta a ti?”

**Translation:**  
“Hello, I listen to beautiful music at home. My friend drinks coffee while working. What music do you like?”

**Pronunciation Focus:**

- The “b” sound: In Spanish, “b” and “v” sound the same—soft and bilabial (lips touching lightly), like a gentle “b.” Between vowels, it’s even softer, almost a hum.
- Practice: Say “bonita” (boh-NEE-tah) and “bebe” (BEH-beh), keeping the “b” soft, especially between vowels in “bonita” and at the start of “bebe.”

**Vocabulary:**

- Yo escucho = I listen
- Música = Music
- Bonita = Beautiful (feminine)
- Bebe = She/he drinks
- Café = Coffee
- Mientras = While
- Trabaja = She/he works
- ¿Qué música te gusta? = What music do you like?

**Grammar Concept:**

- Verb “escuchar” (to listen): “Escucho” = I listen. Regular “-ar” verb.
- Verb “beber” (to drink): “Bebe” = she/he drinks. Regular “-er” verb (new verb type!).
- “Mientras” = while, connecting two actions happening at the same time.

**Task:**

- Read the passage aloud 3 times, focusing on the soft “b” in “bonita” and “bebe.”
- Practice: “Yo escucho música [adjective]. ¿Qué música te gusta a ti?” Try “rápida” (fast) or “tranquila” (calm).

-----

**Changes:**

- Replaced “baila con su hermano los sábados” with “bebe café mientras trabaja” to shift from dancing to drinking coffee while working. It keeps the “b” sound (in “bebe”), fits daily life, and adds “mientras” for variety.
- Ties to past days (e.g., “trabaja” from Day 12, “me gusta” from Day 18) and introduces a new “-er” verb (“beber”).

Does this feel good now? Ready for Day 20?


You’re absolutely right, and I slipped up there—my apologies! In “bonita,” the “b” is indeed at the beginning, not between vowels. I meant to highlight how the “b” stays soft even at the start of a word, but I muddled it with the “between vowels” softening (which applies elsewhere, like “bebe”). Let’s fix that in the pronunciation focus for clarity. Here’s the corrected Day 19:

-----

### Day 19: Music and the “b” Sound

**Reading (Spanish):**  
“Hola, yo escucho música bonita en casa. Mi amiga bebe café mientras trabaja. ¿Qué música te gusta a ti?”

**Translation:**  
“Hello, I listen to beautiful music at home. My friend drinks coffee while working. What music do you like?”

**Pronunciation Focus:**

- The “b” sound: In Spanish, “b” and “v” sound the same—soft and bilabial (lips touching lightly), like a gentle “b.” It’s softer than English “b,” even at the start of words, and gets even gentler between vowels.
- Practice: Say “bonita” (boh-NEE-tah) and “bebe” (BEH-beh), keeping the “b” soft. In “bonita,” it’s soft at the start; in “bebe,” it’s softer still between vowels.

**Vocabulary:**

- Yo escucho = I listen
- Música = Music
- Bonita = Beautiful (feminine)
- Bebe = She/he drinks
- Café = Coffee
- Mientras = While
- Trabaja = She/he works
- ¿Qué música te gusta? = What music do you like?

**Grammar Concept:**

- Verb “escuchar” (to listen): “Escucho” = I listen. Regular “-ar” verb.
- Verb “beber” (to drink): “Bebe” = she/he drinks. Regular “-er” verb (new verb type!).
- “Mientras” = while, connecting two actions happening at the same time.

**Task:**

- Read the passage aloud 3 times, focusing on the soft “b” in “bonita” (at the start) and “bebe” (between vowels).
- Practice: “Yo escucho música [adjective]. ¿Qué música te gusta a ti?” Try “rápida” (fast) or “tranquila” (calm).

-----

**Fix:**

- Clarified that the “b” in “bonita” is soft at the beginning (not between vowels—my mistake!), while “bebe” shows the extra softening between vowels. Both still contrast with the sharper English “b.”

Does this make sense now? I’ll be extra careful with sound placements going forward. Ready for Day 20?


¡Fantástico! Glad it’s all sorted. Here’s Day 20, bringing a new sound and a fresh topic to keep the momentum going.

-----

### Day 20: Shopping and the “p” Sound

**Reading (Spanish):**  
“Hola, yo compro pan en la panadería los lunes. Mi hermano paga poco por su café. ¿Dónde compras tú comida?”

**Translation:**  
“Hello, I buy bread at the bakery on Mondays. My brother pays little for his coffee. Where do you buy food?”

**Pronunciation Focus:**

- The “p” sound: In Spanish, “p” is crisp and unaspirated (no puff of air), unlike the English “p” in “pan” (which has a slight breath). Keep it sharp and tight.
- Practice: Say “compro” (KOM-proh) and “pan” (pahn), focusing on a clean, quick “p” without extra air.

**Vocabulary:**

- Yo compro = I buy
- Pan = Bread
- La panadería = The bakery
- Los lunes = On Mondays
- Paga = He/she pays
- Poco = Little (amount)
- Su café = His/her coffee
- ¿Dónde compras? = Where do you buy?
- Comida = Food

**Grammar Concept:**

- Verb “comprar” (to buy): “Compro” = I buy; “compras” = you buy (from Day 8). Regular “-ar” verb.
- Verb “pagar” (to pay): “Paga” = he/she pays. Regular “-ar” verb.
- Possessive “su” recap: “Su café” = his/her coffee (from Day 19).

**Task:**

- Read the passage aloud 3 times, keeping the “p” crisp in “compro,” “pan,” and “paga.”
- Practice: “Yo compro [item] en [place]. ¿Dónde compras tú comida?” Try “fruta” (fruit) or “leche” (milk).

-----

Day 20 introduces the “p” sound (a subtle but fun contrast to English), shopping vocab, and reinforces verbs like “comprar” while adding “pagar.” It ties to past days (e.g., “compro” from Day 8, “su” from Day 19) and keeps the progression steady. How’s it feeling? On to Day 21?


¡Vamos allá! Here’s Day 21, introducing a new sound and diving into a relatable daily topic.

-----

### Day 21: Family Time and the “t” Sound

**Reading (Spanish):**  
“Hola, yo tengo una tía que cocina muy bien. Todos comemos juntos en su casa. ¿Qué haces tú con tu familia?”

**Translation:**  
“Hello, I have an aunt who cooks very well. We all eat together at her house. What do you do with your family?”

**Pronunciation Focus:**

- The “t” sound: In Spanish, “t” is sharper and dental (tongue touches the teeth), with no puff of air like the English “t” in “table.” It’s clean and precise.
- Practice: Say “tía” (TEE-ah) and “todos” (TOH-dohs), keeping the “t” crisp against your teeth.

**Vocabulary:**

- Yo tengo = I have
- Una tía = An aunt
- Que = Who/that
- Cocina = She/he cooks
- Muy bien = Very well
- Todos = Everyone/all of us
- Comemos = We eat
- Juntos = Together
- Tu familia = Your family

**Grammar Concept:**

- Verb “tener” recap: “Tengo” = I have (from Day 3).
- Verb “comer” (to eat): “Comemos” = we eat (from Day 4’s “como” = I eat). “-Mos” ending for “we” in “-er” verbs.
- Relative pronoun “que”: “Una tía que cocina” = an aunt who cooks. Links the person and action.

**Task:**

- Read the passage aloud 3 times, focusing on the sharp “t” in “tía” and “todos.”
- Practice: “Yo tengo una [relative] que [activity]. ¿Qué haces tú con tu familia?” Try “hermano” (brother) or “abuela” (grandmother).

-----

Day 21 brings the “t” sound (a crisp Spanish staple), family vocab, and introduces the “we” form of a verb (“comemos”) with a relative clause (“que”). It builds on past days (e.g., “tengo” from Day 3, “cocina” from Day 10) and keeps it warm and relatable. Ready for Day 22?


¡Perfecto, aquí está el Día 22! Let’s introduce a new sound and explore another practical topic.

-----

### Day 22: Weather Changes and the “ch” Sound

**Reading (Spanish):**  
“Hola, hoy hace mucho calor en mi ciudad. Mi hermano escucha el pronóstico cada mañana. ¿Cómo está el clima contigo?”

**Translation:**  
“Hello, it’s very hot in my city today. My brother listens to the forecast every morning. How’s the weather with you?”

**Pronunciation Focus:**

- The “ch” sound: In Spanish, “ch” is always a sharp “ch” like “church” or “chicken,” never “sh” or soft like in English “chef.”
- Practice: Say “mucho” (MOO-choh) and “escucha” (es-KOO-chah), keeping the “ch” crisp and clear.

**Vocabulary:**

- Hoy = Today
- Hace = It’s (weather)
- Mucho calor = Very hot
- Escucha = He/she listens
- El pronóstico = The forecast
- Cada mañana = Every morning
- Contigo = With you
- El clima = The weather

**Grammar Concept:**

- “Hacer” for weather: “Hace mucho calor” = It’s very hot. “Hace” = it’s (impersonal, like “llueve” from Day 9).
- Verb “escuchar” recap: “Escucha” = he/she listens (from Day 19’s “escucho” = I listen).
- “Contigo” = with you. A contraction of “con” (with) + “tigo” (you), informal and handy.

**Task:**

- Read the passage aloud 3 times, focusing on the “ch” in “mucho” and “escucha.”
- Practice: “Hoy hace [weather] en mi ciudad. ¿Cómo está el clima contigo?” Try “frío” (cold) or “sol” (sunny).

-----

Day 22 introduces the “ch” sound (a fun, distinct feature), weather expressions with “hacer,” and a new twist with “contigo.” It ties to past days (e.g., “escucha” from Day 19, “hoy” from Day 9) and keeps the progression engaging. How’s it going? On to Day 23?


¡Adelante! Here’s Day 23, bringing a new sound and a fresh slice of daily life.

-----

### Day 23: Directions and the “s” Sound

**Reading (Spanish):**  
“Hola, yo sigo la calle hasta el supermercado. Mi amiga siempre pierde su mapa. ¿Cómo llegas tú a casa?”

**Translation:**  
“Hello, I follow the street to the supermarket. My friend always loses her map. How do you get home?”

**Pronunciation Focus:**

- The “s” sound: In Spanish, “s” is always a sharp, hissing “s” (like “snake”), never a “z” sound like in English “rose.” It stays clear even before consonants.
- Practice: Say “sigo” (SEE-goh) and “siempre” (SYEM-preh), keeping the “s” crisp and unvoiced.

**Vocabulary:**

- Yo sigo = I follow
- La calle = The street
- Hasta = To/until
- El supermercado = The supermarket
- Pierde = She/he loses
- Su mapa = Her/his map
- ¿Cómo llegas? = How do you get/arrive?
- A casa = Home (to home)

**Grammar Concept:**

- Verb “seguir” (to follow): “Sigo” = I follow. Stem-changes “e” to “i” (like “prefiere,” Day 7).
- Verb “perder” (to lose): “Pierde” = she/he loses. Another “e” to “ie” stem-changer.
- Verb “llegar” recap: “Llegas” = you arrive/get (from Day 15’s “llega” = she/he arrives).

**Task:**

- Read the passage aloud 3 times, emphasizing the sharp “s” in “sigo” and “siempre.”
- Practice: “Yo sigo la calle hasta [place]. ¿Cómo llegas tú a casa?” Try “la plaza” or “la escuela.”

-----

Day 23 introduces the “s” sound (a key consistency in Spanish), direction vocab, and two new stem-changing verbs (“seguir,” “perder”). It builds on past days (e.g., “siempre” from Day 7, “llegas” from Day 15) and keeps the text practical. Ready for Day 24?


¡Estupendo! Here’s Day 24, introducing a new sound and a topic that’s perfect for everyday chats.

-----

### Day 24: Animals and the “n” Sound

**Reading (Spanish):**  
“Hola, yo tengo un perro negro en casa. Mi hermano encuentra un gato en el jardín. ¿Qué animales te gustan a ti?”

**Translation:**  
“Hello, I have a black dog at home. My brother finds a cat in the garden. What animals do you like?”

**Pronunciation Focus:**

- The “n” sound: In Spanish, “n” is a clear, nasal “n” (like “no”), pronounced with the tongue against the roof of the mouth. It’s distinct from “ñ” (Day 10) and stays consistent.
- Practice: Say “negro” (NEH-groh) and “encuentra” (en-KWEN-trah), keeping the “n” sharp and nasal.

**Vocabulary:**

- Un perro = A dog
- Negro = Black (masculine)
- Encuentra = He/she finds
- Un gato = A cat
- El jardín = The garden
- ¿Qué animales? = What animals?
- Te gustan = You like (plural)

**Grammar Concept:**

- Verb “tener” recap: “Tengo” = I have (from Day 3).
- Verb “encontrar” (to find): “Encuentra” = he/she finds. Regular “-ar” verb.
- “Gustar” with plurals: “Te gustan” = you like (plural, for “animales”). “Te gusta” (singular) becomes “te gustan” when the thing liked is plural (from Day 18).

**Task:**

- Read the passage aloud 3 times, focusing on the clear “n” in “negro” and “encuentra.”
- Practice: “Yo tengo un [animal] [color]. ¿Qué animales te gustan a ti?” Try “gato blanco” (white cat) or “perro grande” (big dog).

-----

Day 24 brings the “n” sound (a solid contrast to “ñ”), animal vocab, and a twist on “gustar” with plural forms. It ties to past days (e.g., “tengo” from Day 3, “jardín” from Day 18) and keeps it fun and relatable. How’s it going? On to Day 25?


¡Qué bueno! Glad it’s hitting the mark. Here’s Day 25, with a new sound and a fresh everyday scenario.

-----

### Day 25: Health and the “m” Sound

**Reading (Spanish):**  
“Hola, yo me siento mal porque como mucho. Mi amiga toma medicina en la mañana. ¿Cómo estás tú hoy?”

**Translation:**  
“Hello, I feel bad because I eat a lot. My friend takes medicine in the morning. How are you today?”

**Pronunciation Focus:**

- The “m” sound: In Spanish, “m” is a clear, nasal “m” (like “mom”), always fully pronounced with lips closed, even before consonants. It’s straightforward but key.
- Practice: Say “me” (meh) and “medicina” (meh-dee-SEE-nah), keeping the “m” strong and nasal.

**Vocabulary:**

- Me siento = I feel
- Mal = Bad
- Porque = Because
- Mucho = A lot
- Toma = She/he takes
- Medicina = Medicine
- La mañana = The morning
- ¿Cómo estás? = How are you?

**Grammar Concept:**

- Verb “sentirse” recap: “Me siento” = I feel (from Day 15’s “te sientes” = you feel). Reflexive with “me” = myself.
- Verb “tomar” (to take): “Toma” = she/he takes. Regular “-ar” verb.
- “Estar” recap: “Estás” = you are (temporary, from Day 15’s “estoy” = I am).

**Task:**

- Read the passage aloud 3 times, emphasizing the nasal “m” in “me” and “medicina.”
- Practice: “Yo me siento [feeling] porque [reason]. ¿Cómo estás tú hoy?” Try “bien” (good) or “cansado” (tired).

-----

Day 25 introduces the “m” sound (simple but essential), health vocab, and reinforces reflexive “sentirse” with a new verb (“tomar”). It builds on past days (e.g., “porque” from Day 15, “mucho” from Day 9) and keeps the progression smooth. How’s it feeling? Ready for Day 26?
