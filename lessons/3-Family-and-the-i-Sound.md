## Day 3: Family and the “i” Sound

### Reading (Spanish):  
“Mi familia es grande. Yo tengo dos hermanos y una hermana. ¿Tú tienes familia?”

### Translation:  
“My family is big. I have two brothers and one sister. Do you have family?”

### Pronunciation Focus:

- The “i” sound: Always “ee” (like “see”), short and sharp, never like “eye” in English.
- Practice: Say “mi” (mee) and “familia” (fah-MEE-lee-ah), stressing the “i” each time it appears.

### Vocabulary:

- Mi familia = My family
- Grande = Big
- Yo tengo = I have
- Dos hermanos = Two brothers
- Una hermana = One sister
- ¿Tú tienes? = Do you have?

### Grammar Concept:

- Numbers and gender: “Dos” (two) is neutral, but “hermanos” (brothers) is masculine, and “hermana” (sister) is feminine with “una” (one, feminine).
- Verb “tener” (to have): “Yo tengo” = I have; “¿Tú tienes?” = Do you have?

### Task:

- Read the passage aloud 3 times, exaggerating the “ee” sound in “mi” and “familia.”
- Say: “Yo tengo [number] hermanos/hermanas,” using your own family (or make it up!).
